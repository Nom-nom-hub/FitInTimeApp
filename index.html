        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>
            FitInTime does not collect any personal information from its users. All workout data, settings, 
            and preferences are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers or any 
            third parties.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            All data created within the app (including workout routines, progress tracking, and app settings) 
            is stored locally on your device using Android's built-in storage mechanisms. This data remains on 
            your device and is not synchronized with any external servers.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Log Data</h2>
        <p>
            When you use our app, in case of an error, we may collect data and information (through third-party 
            products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device's 
            Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, app configuration, the time 
            and date of your use of the app, and other statistics. This information is used solely for the purpose 
            of improving the app's functionality and user experience.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Cookies</h2>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Our app does not include or integrate with any third-party services that collect user data.

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Our app does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally 
            identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are 
            aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that 
            we can take necessary actions.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting 
            the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically 
            for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
